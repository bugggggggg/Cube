# Cube



## Guide

We use **Unity3D** to develop a 3D magic cube interactive system, which is used to simulate the real magic cube, and provides functions such as restoration and formula.

The purpose of this project is because the popular CFOP restoration method has many complex formulas. It is difficult to understand the operation process directly through pictures, and it is not easy to learn and remember. Therefore, we have developed such a magic cube 3D interactive system, and added all the formulas into the system. Users can view the operation steps of each formula intuitively, And restore the whole magic cube at the prompt of the system.
